This extension allows users to play a bingo game about the streamer erobb221, blur parts of the overlay, and throw virtual tomatoes at the screen.

The overlay uses a built-in chatbot to display the bingo board.

ChangeLog:

- Added more tile options to the bingo board
- Overlay: You can blur a part of the screen by holding ctrl, left-click and dragging the mouse over the area you want to blur. ctrl+left-click again to remove the box.
- Overlay: You can hide the bingo board and prevent virtual tomatoes from being thrown on your display by clicking alt + shift, and left-click on the screen. A confirmation modal will appear to confirm that you want to hide the board and prevent virutal tomatoes from being thrown. The bingo broad and tomatoes feature can be brought back by doing the same action: alt+shift+left-click.

Chatbot Commands: what happens if @abdullahmorrison or a moderator types one of these commands in erobb221's chat

- !bingo: opens the overlay bingo board
- !startthrowing: 30-second timer starts that allows the chat to throw virtual tomatoes at the screen by typing TomatoTime
