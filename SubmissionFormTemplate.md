This extension allows users to play a bingo game about the streamer erobb221 and throw virtual tomatoes at the screen.

The overlay uses a built-in chatbot to display the bingo board.

ChangeLog:

- Added tiles to the bingo board
- Overlay: You can blur a part of the screen by holding ctrl, left-click and dragging the mouse over the area you want to blur
- Overlay: You can hide the bingo board and prevent virtual tomatoes from being thrown on your display by clicking alt + shift, and left-click on the screen. A confirmation modal will appear to confirm that you want to hide the board and prevent virutal tomatoes from being thrown.
